# Custom Data Splits MLB Hitter Report Cards

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create simple yet data-rich graphics that provide a comprehensive view of MLB hitter statistics, including both standard and advanced metrics, for custom date ranges. These graphics serve as a fast and efficient tool for evaluating hitters, designed specifically for use by coaches and analysts.

Whether a hitter has made a mechanical adjustment to their swing, implemented a new swing decision strategy, or is recovering from an injury, these cards offer valuable insights into their performance.
